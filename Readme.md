Frontend Documentation (UI Side)
This documentation explains how the frontend of the Dashboard application is structured, focusing on the UI side only. It describes the tech stack, modules, state management, and design principles.

Tech Stack
Framework: Next.js (v15.4.6)
‚Ä¢	Used for server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and optimized routing.
‚Ä¢	Provides an App Router structure for modular and scalable UI development.
‚Ä¢	Ensures performance and SEO benefits with hybrid rendering.
UI Library: React (v19.1.0) + TailwindCSS (^3.x)
‚Ä¢	React powers the component-based structure. React 19 introduces improved concurrent rendering and better developer ergonomics.
‚Ä¢	TailwindCSS is used for styling with utility-first classes, keeping design consistent and fast to implement.
‚Ä¢	tailwind-merge helps avoid conflicting Tailwind classes, and clsx allows for conditional styling (e.g., active/inactive states).
UI Components: Radix UI
‚Ä¢	Provides accessible, unstyled components that integrate well with Tailwind.
‚Ä¢	Used for key UI interactions:
o	react-dialog: Modals for forms (e.g., Create Project, Edit Task).
o	react-dropdown-menu: Menus for user actions (edit, delete, assign).
o	react-avatar: User profile icons and member lists.
o	react-select: Dropdowns for filtering, role selection, task status.
o	react-label: Accessible labels for form inputs.
o	react-progress: Visual progress indicators for projects and tasks.
Icons: Lucide React
‚Ä¢	Provides modern SVG icons (e.g., Bell, Plus, Edit, Trash).
‚Ä¢	Fully customizable with Tailwind classes.
Charts & Analytics: Recharts
‚Ä¢	A charting library used for analytics dashboards.
‚Ä¢	Provides Bar, Line, and Pie charts for visualizing:
o	Project progress
o	Task completion rate
o	User activity statistics
State Management: Zustand
‚Ä¢	Lightweight, scalable state management solution.
‚Ä¢	Stores will be defined for projects, tasks, users, and notifications.
‚Ä¢	Provides global state without heavy boilerplate.
Utilities
‚Ä¢	date-fns: Used for formatting dates (e.g., task deadlines, notification timestamps).
‚Ä¢	uuid: Generates unique IDs for projects, tasks, and notifications.

 Dashboard Structure (UI Layout)
Sidebar Navigation
‚Ä¢	Persistent sidebar for navigation between modules.
‚Ä¢	Contains links for: Projects, Tasks, Users, Analytics, Notifications.
‚Ä¢	Icons from Lucide React for visual clarity.
Top Navbar
‚Ä¢	Contains search bar, quick actions, and theme switch.
‚Ä¢	User Avatar Dropdown for profile and logout.
‚Ä¢	Bell Icon for notifications, with a badge showing unread count.

üîê Authentication & Roles
This API uses JWT for authentication. A valid token is required for all private endpoints. The system enforces Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions:
Admin: Has full CRUD access to projects and tasks, and can manage members.
User: Can view projects, update the status of their assigned tasks, add comments, and receive notifications.
 
üìä Database Schema (Prisma)
Key models:
User: name, email, password (hashed), role (ADMIN/USER), avatar


Project: owned by a user, contains tasks & members


Task: linked to a project, can be assigned to a user


Comment: linked to a task & user


Notification: tracks actions like task assignment, updates, and comments
